            <p class="text-gray">The name Deganwy has been interpreted in modern times as Din-Gonwy, which would mean "Fort on the River Conwy", but the historical spellings make it impossible for this to be the actual origin of the name.Deganwy is swish and sophisticated. On the shores of the Conwy Estuary between Victorian Llandudno and medieval Conwy, it enjoys a privileged position with stunning views across the water to Conwy Castle and the Isle of Anglesey. There‚Äôs a sand and stone beach and ‚Äì Deganwy‚Äôs prized feature ‚Äì a sleek, modern marina and quayside development complete with spa hotel. The town is also noted for its stylish shopping and dining with a good choice of boutiques and restaurants.
                A little further south, but still beside the water, Llandudno Junction is a lively spot with a large nine-screened multiplex cinema and plenty of free parking. Nature lovers are drawn to the natural spectacle of the RSPB Conwy Nature Reserve, a wetland reserve beside the River Conwy noted for its black-tailed godwits, lapwings, sedge warblers, shelducks and water rails. This welcoming reserve makes sure that there‚Äôs something going on throughout the year with a full programme of events. With its well laid out walks, watch points and picnic sites, it‚Äôs not surprising that the reserve is a big hit with families as well as serious ornithologists. </p>
