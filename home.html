                    <p class="text-gray">The name Deganwy has been interpreted in modern times as Din-Gonwy, which would mean "Fort on the River Conwy", but the historical spellings make it impossible for this to be the actual origin of the name although mentioned in Domesday Book is "the territory of the Decanae tribe". The original wooden castle was rebuilt in stone after 1210.</p>

                        EIFEL TOWER, PARIS
                    </h3>
                    <p class="text-gray">The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and √âmile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des √âtablissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853</p>
